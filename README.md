SDG Problem Addressed
Goal: SDG 13 (Climate Action) — Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
Problem: Unpredictable CO₂ emissions hinder effective mitigation strategies. This project forecasts emissions to identify high-risk regions, optimize resource allocation (e.g., renewable energy investments), and track progress toward global targets like the Paris Agreement.

ML Approach
Technique: Supervised Learning (Random Forest Regression).
Why Regression? Predicts continuous CO₂ emission levels (in gigatons) based on historical trends.
Features Used: GDP, population, energy use, and year.
Dataset: Global Carbon Budget (1990–2022, 150+ countries).

Workflow:
Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized numerical features.
Model Training: Random Forest (100 trees) for robustness against outliers.
Evaluation: Split data (80% train, 20% test); used MAE (0.18) and R² (0.92).

Results
High Accuracy:
R² = 0.92: Model explains 92% of emission variability.
MAE = 0.18 gigatons: Low error margin (e.g., predicts 4.5 GT actual vs 4.32 GT forecast).

Key Drivers:
GDP (48% impact): Economic growth correlates strongly with emissions.
Energy Use (32% impact): Fossil fuel dependency dominates.

Policy Insights:
High-GDP nations (e.g., USA, China) should prioritize green energy transitions.
Model forecasts a 12% emissions rise by 2030 without intervention.

Ethical Considerations
Bias in Data:
Risk: Emissions from low-income regions (e.g., Africa) are underreported, skewing predictions.
Mitigation: Supplemented with satellite data (NASA OCO-2) for global coverage.

Equity & Fairness:
Risk: Penalizing developing economies for emissions they didn’t historically cause.
Mitigation: Focus policy recommendations on per capita emissions and equitable green financing.

Sustainability Impact:
Promotes evidence-based policies (e.g., redirect $500B subsidies from fossils to renewables).
Avoids "one-size-fits-all" strategies, ensuring solutions adapt to regional needs.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how ML can turn climate data into actionable insights. By forecasting emissions with 92% accuracy, it empowers governments to target high-impact areas, advancing SDG 13. Future work: Integrate real-time API data for dynamic policy adjustments.
